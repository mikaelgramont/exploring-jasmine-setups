# Summary
A small repo to explore how to setup Jasmine properly.

There is so much info out there, so many combinations of tools and processes (ES6? Webpack? Browserify?) and things move so fast that it's impossible to get a working setup without spending many hoursjust trying to get things to work. So here I am.

# Installation
Clone the repo, and run ```npm install```.

# Commands
Run ```npm run build``` to generate the JS bundle.
Run ```karma start``` to run all tests in a headless browser.
